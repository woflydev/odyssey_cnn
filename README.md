# Project Odyssey 2023

Visit [our website](https://aboutodyssey.web.app) to learn more about us and the team. We are a passionate group of individuals developing a custom made robot designed to compete with universities around Australia in the [Droid Racing Competition](https://qutrobotics.com/droid-racing-challenge/). The DRC is held annually in July with teams from all around the country flying to Brisbane's QUT Campus to compete. Last year, we finished honourably at 7th, out of 15 national universities, beating both the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Sydney (USYD), becoming the youngest ever team to compete in DRC history.

We operate under the [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which means that any product you make with our code must be open-source and available to the general public.


## Software Tech Stack

**Lane and Object Detection:** OpenCV, Tensorflow, Python, YoloV5

**Model Training:** Google Colaboratory
## Installation

Git (recommended):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/woflydev/odyssey_cnn.git
cd odyssey_cnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh repo clone woflydev/odyssey_cnn
cd odyssey_cnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage/Examples

Usage of our custom motor controller based on the Raspberry Pi's GPIO is as follows:
```python
from motors import move, off
import time

# 'move' takes a value out of 100.
move(50, 50)
time.sleep(1)

# shorthand for move(0, 0)
off()
```

Usage of our motor throttle calculation algorithm is as follows:
```python
import throttle_calc

r = 10 # where 'r' is base speed out of 100
theta = 0 # where 'theta' is desired heading, with 0 being straight

# throttle_calc returns a tuple. do with that what you will.
left_speed = throttle_calc(r, theta)[0]
right_speed = throttle_calc(r, theta)[1]
```

More functions can be found below.

| `log_level` | `string` | DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, CRITICAL levels can be selected. |


#### Extraction of Training Data

```python
import y_data_extractor
y_data_extractor(file_path, file_name, output_dir)
```

Alternatively, call from command line:

```python
y_data_extractor.py file_path file_name output_dir
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `file_path` | `valid system path` | **Required**, Dashcam footage for data extraction. |
| `file_name` | `valid filename` | **Required**, Dashcam footage filename. |
| `output_dir` | `valid system path` | **Required**, Directory in which extracted data should be outputted. |


#### Lane Detection with CNN (to do)

```python
import odyssey_cnn
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `x`      | `x` | x |
| `x`      | `x` | x |
| `x`      | `x` | x |


#### Object Detection with CNN (to do)

```python
import odyssey_object_cnn
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `x`      | `x` | x |
| `x`      | `x` | x |
| `x`      | `x` | x |

## 
ing and Forking

While we are all for contributing in open-source projects, we will not be accepting any outside contributions due to the nature of the competition. However, you are welcome to fork the code and make your own modifications as per usual.

Before making modifications in your own cloned repo or fork, make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and update `.gitignore` to your own needs.

That said, if you really *really* ***really*** want to contribute, open a pull request and we'll review it.

See `z_opencv_driver.py` for the pure OpenCV implementation of our custom lane detection and motor calculation algorithm. Our convolutional neural network's trained model has not been uploaded to the repository as of yet, but the basis for using the model to drive can be found at `z_cnn_driver.py`. Training data was extracted by using `y_data_extractor.py`. To pick the HSV values accurately for the `OpenCV_Driver` class, you can use the `y_hsv_picker.py` tool.

`x_test.py` is only used for testing in a Windows environment when the robot is not available, and simulates the robot's movements through text prompts.


## Feedback

If you have any suggestions for our project and competition, you can reach us  from our website [here](https://aboutodyssey.web.app/). Alternatively, you can open an issue on our repository.
